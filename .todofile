# Lines marked with '#' at the beginning are comments.
# This file stores todo entries for todo program, you typically shouldn't modify this file directly (but it's up to you).
# Note that after each run of todo program this file gets wiped out and rewritten again, which means any other comments other then those three will get deleted.
